The application is calculating fuel costs based on car consumption , employee kilometers limit and the price of gasoline (which is hard coded). 
In addition there is a validation step that is verifying when the last technical inspection has been done and if it has to be renewed, 
adds the price to the overall charge that needs to be paid.
doctrine:schema:update --force on a empty data base called car_park_manager will do the formatting and you will be able to run the app end to end.
